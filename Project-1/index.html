    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>Normally people call me <em>Victor</em> or <em>Pagotto</em>. I'm from Brazil, Ji-Paraná RO,
        and I've grown in this city. <br>I'm a simple and nerdy guy who really likes music, 
        games, tabletop RPG and to learn about many general topics,<br> like scientific, historic,
        and social facts. I'm also a guy who loves technology in general; after all, 
        I grew<br> up with a PC and an internet conection as a main thing, making of technology something that
        always was<br> in my lifestyle. </p>
